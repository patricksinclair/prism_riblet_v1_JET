This is based on the prism_riblet_v1 system.

The jet part is in reference to the upper wall velocity boundary condition now having a vertical component too.

We'll leave the pressure boundary conditions alone for now, and use a reasonably low jet velocity of 1 m/s.

Currently varying the biofilm thickness and the riblet separation. Current riblet separations are 23, 46 and 92 microns.

Biofilm thicknesses are:

thick = 60 microns
thin = 21 microns
level = 42 microns

Gravity was still turned on, I've turned it off now, see if it changes anything.
